\section{Background of the Study}

There has been many reasons why one tries to avoid any outdoor activity but one of these is how the air feels whether it is too hot or too polluted or even both. One undeniable fact is that heat and humidity all play roles in making the weather hot. Both of these weather parameters are involved in the calculation of the heat index and the discomfort index.
\par \noindent
Heat index and discomfort index have their similarities because the factors that affect these two are the temperature and the relative humidity. The heat index is the perceived temperature by people when the rising temperature and the relative humidity is combined. The unit used here is a unit of temperature and the mathematical formula for computing the heat index shows a rather direct square proportionality with the temperature and the humidity. But when it comes to a more human readable scale, reaching 34 degrees Celsius is already a discomfort to some. Reaching at least 46 degrees Celsius is already dangerous to all as this can cause heat stroke and even imminent death to some people. The discomfort index is similar to the heat index but instead, its mathematical formula only indicates a direct proportionality with the temperature and the relative humidity. The scaling is rather similar to that in the heat index. When the discomfort index reaches at least 21 degrees Celsius, it is already a discomfort for some people. Reaching 29 degrees Celsius is already dangerous to all that when it even gets higher, a state of emergency can be declared.
\par \noindent
The human body is capable of regulating body temperature because of its abilities as a warm-blooded organism. When the human body detects extreme temperatures, it drastically adjusts the body just to get the internal temperature back to a normal 37 degrees Celsius. When your body detects a lot of heat, it tries to cool itself down by increasing your heart rate and sweating. However, one can sweat too much, he feels drained by the lack of fluids in his body causing discomfort, weakness, loss of stamina, and even muscle pains, leading to a heat stroke.
\par \noindent
Other than high temperatures and humidity, the pollutants in the air can be harmful to the respiratory system. Dust is a particle suspended in the air and it usually comes from the soil or the pollution. This can cause irritation in the respiratory system because dust entering the lungs can cause serious complications. This is already bad for those with respiratory problems such as asthma or emphysema. Carbon monoxide, however, is a colorless and odorless gas and it usually comes from smoke. When this is inhaled, it can cause serious complications in the body since this inhibits the delivery of oxygen from the blood to the other organs in the body which can cause death. Not only do all of this increase the risk of getting sickness but these also affect the visibility of an area.
\par \noindent
This study will focus on a mobile application that enables people to have a foresight on how the outside air feels like. A microcontroller-based system will be used in detecting the parameters stated above while the mobile application will take note of the visibility with the use of the phone's camera.

\section{Prior Studies}

Some of the studies that the group has found are about the temperature and humidity monitoring systems. The temperature system can be constructed by using a simple microcontroller-based system with an important tool, the LM35 where the output voltage is directly proportional to the temperature detected. The same procedure can be done with the humidity sensor but this time, it does not make use of the LM35. Both of these sensors are good for agricultural applications and getting the air quality. Another study involves the use of PM10 sensors in order to detect particulate matter that is 10 micrometers wide. An algorithm has been made with the use of the atmospheric reflectance for temporal monitoring. Another study introduces another concept of air monitoring by taking note of the pollutants present which are namely carbon monoxide, PM 2.5 , and ozone which make use of the MQ-7 4
sensor, MQ-131 sensor, and Sharp dust sensor respectively. Another study made use of getting the discomfort index by using temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, and carbon dioxide sensors. Finally, a study states the standards set by different parts of the world when it comes to the air quality. These standards all make use of the amount of pollutants present in the air as basis of air quality.



\section{Problem Statement}

Though there have been mobile applications that display the weather in real time, none have been able to show the discomfort index given the data. Also, there are no applications that tell the amount of dust or carbon monoxide in the air considering that these are some important factors when people choose to commute by an ordinary jeepney or do any outdoor activity in urban areas.
\par \noindent
The aim of this study is to develop a new mobile application that is able to report the condition of the air such as weather parameters and the amount of pollutants present. The system will make use of a microcontroller along with different sensors that will measure the said parameters. Also, the mobile application will make use of computer vision to measure the visibility in an area.
\par \noindent
Can a mobile application be developed to report real time conditions of the air and the amount of pollutants present with the used of a sensor-based microcontroller system?

\section{Significance of the Study}

The significance of this topic is to be able to design and produce a device of checking the air quality and discomfort index for the public health awareness. There are millions of commuters in the Philippines riding jeepneys or light rail transit system. The problem of this way of commuting is the air because there are a lot of old vehicles producing smoke and most people just breathe in either direct or indirect way. It is very important for the people to know the status of the air to secure their respiratory health. Together with this, the group aim to the user friendly device that anyone can easily understand how to use the device through an android application. Since a lot of people uses android mobile phones, making an application for free will be very helpful. The application will display the required data in graphics so that it is easy to understand for the public and to make the aware of the effect of the environment to their health. This study will surely help a lot of people who still donâ€™t know about why it is important to know the air we are breathing outside.


\section{Assumptions, Scope and Delimitations}

%Bulletize your scope in one group, and then bulletize the delimitations in another.  Bulletize your assumptions as well.
\begin{enumerate}
\item The given data will only be determined by the air quality index and the discomfort index.
