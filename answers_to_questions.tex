\section{How important is the problem to practice?}

The Philippines is a country that is prone to discomfort due to the inevitable elements of air pollution and rising heat levels. An Android application for awareness can be able to alert the locals about these issues.	
	
\section{How will you know if the solution/s that you will achieve would be better than existing ones?}	

Currently, there are no Android applications that provide real-time updates on discomfort index and amount of dust and carbon monoxide in a Philippine implementation.

\section{What is the difference of the solution/s from existing ones?}
	
Weather reports provide temperature and humidity in different parts of the world but our solution combines them both into a discomfort index derived from heat which is an essential factor in the levels of comfort of an individual.

\subsection{How is it different from previous and existing ones?}

Weather stations provide measurements pertaining to temperature and humidity but in this solution, the measurements can be accurately measured with an Arduino-based system. The crowd sourcing element in the research enables these data to be updated time and time again, faster than an selecting an interval of a daily update.
